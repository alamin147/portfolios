## üîß Manual Configuration Required

### **SPF Record Configuration** (High Priority)
**Issue**: Your DNS server is not using an SPF record.

**What is SPF?**
SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is a DNS record that specifies which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain. This helps prevent email spoofing and improves email deliverability.

**How to Fix**:

1. **Access Your Domain DNS Settings**
   - Log in to your domain registrar (where you bought your domain)
   - Navigate to DNS settings/DNS management

2. **Add an SPF Record**
   - Record Type: `TXT`
   - Name/Host: `@` (or your domain name)
   - Value: Choose based on your email setup:

   ```
   # If you don't send emails from your domain:
   v=spf1 -all

   # If you use Google Workspace/Gmail:
   v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all

   # If you use Microsoft 365/Outlook:
   v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all

   # If you use Vercel and Google:
   v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:spf.vercel.com ~all

   # Generic safe default (allows no email):
   v=spf1 ~all
   ```

3. **Recommended SPF Record for Portfolio Sites**:
   ```
   v=spf1 -all
   ```
   This indicates that your domain doesn't send emails, which is typical for portfolio sites.

4. **TTL**: Set to 3600 (1 hour) or use default

**Verification**:
- Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Check using: https://mxtoolbox.com/spf.aspx
- Or use command: `nslookup -type=txt yourdomain.com`

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Low Priority Items (Optional)

### **HTTP/2 Protocol**
**Issue**: "This Webpage Is Not Using HTTP/2 Protocol"

**Note**: This is likely a false positive. Vercel automatically serves sites over HTTP/2.

**Verification**:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Add "Protocol" column (right-click on column headers)
4. Reload your site
5. Check if Protocol shows "h2" (HTTP/2)

**No action needed** - Vercel handles this automatically.

---

### **Inline CSS Styles**
**Issue**: "Your webpage is using 19 inline CSS styles"

**Current State**: Some inline styles are necessary for:
- Critical above-the-fold rendering
- Dynamic styles in React components
- Noscript fallback styling

**Impact**: Low - Modern development practices use CSS-in-JS and inline styles for component-scoped styling.

**If you want to optimize**:
1. Move static styles to external CSS files
2. Use Tailwind classes instead of inline styles where possible
3. Keep dynamic styles inline (acceptable practice)

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is for now. The performance impact is minimal.

---

### **Server Signature**
**Issue**: "Warning, your server signature is ON"

**Note**: This is a Vercel infrastructure setting and cannot be changed at the application level.

**Security**: Vercel has enterprise-grade security. The server signature doesn't pose a significant security risk for your use case.

**No action available** - This is controlled by Vercel's infrastructure.
