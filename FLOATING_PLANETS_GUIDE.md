## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`src/data/planets-data.ts`** - Planet data structure and information
2. **`src/components/floating-planets.tsx`** - Main floating planets component
3. **`src/components/planet-modal.tsx`** - Modal with planet details

### Modified Files:
1. **`src/index.css`** - Added planet-specific CSS animations
2. **`src/App.tsx`** - Integrated FloatingPlanets component

## Usage

The planets are now automatically displayed on all pages. They:
- Float in fixed positions across the viewport
- Are clickable to open detailed information
- Don't interfere with scrolling or other interactions (pointer-events managed)
- Have a z-index of 5 to stay above background but below navbar

## Customization

### Add More Planets
Edit `src/data/planets-data.ts` and add new planet objects with:
```typescript
{
  id: "planet-name",
  name: "Planet Name",
  title: "The Subtitle",
  description: "Short description",
  details: ["Detail 1", "Detail 2", ...],
  color: "#hexcolor",
  gradient: "linear-gradient(...)",
  size: "100px",
  orbitDuration: "20s",
  facts: [{ label: "Fact", value: "Value" }],
  icon: "üåç"
}
```

### Change Positions
Edit the `positions` array in `src/components/floating-planets.tsx`:
```typescript
const positions = [
  { top: "15%", left: "10%", delay: "0s" },
  // Add more positions...
];
```

### Modify Animations
Edit animation speeds in `src/index.css` by changing duration values in keyframes.

## Performance
- Planets use CSS transforms for smooth GPU-accelerated animations
- Modal lazy-loads content only when opened
- Optimized with React hooks for efficient state management

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS animations support
- Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Touch-friendly for mobile devices

## Tips
- Planets are positioned using percentages for responsive placement
- Glass-morphism effects used for modern UI aesthetic
- Scrollbar styled in modal for consistent look
- All animations can be paused by removing animation classes

Enjoy your cosmic portfolio! üåå‚ú®
